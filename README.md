</h1>

This is the second iteration of my personal website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Clone the repository**

    Use the Git CLI to clone this repository.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/hamzabasrai/hamzabasrai.com_v2
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies.**

    Navigate into the site’s directory and install dependencies with Yarn.

    ```shell
    cd hamzabasrai.com_v2/
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server.**

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in this Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package.json
    ├── README.md
    └── yarn.lock

1.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you see on the front-end of the site (what you see in the browser) such as the site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

2.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

3.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

4.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

5.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

6.  **`LICENSE`**: This website is licensed under the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). Make sure to replace it with your own license if forking this repository.

7.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

9.  **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
